# RoThesis
University of Roehampton - LaTeX template for a PhD Thesis

Use this template to produce a standard thesis that meets the Roehampton University requirements for DPhil submission

This template was originally the " OXFORD THESIS TEMPLATE" by Keith A. Gillow 1997, which was in turn modified by Sam Evans 2007, and then by John McManigle 2015. Ultimately I (Diego Vitali) have added further adaptations to adhere Roehampton standard 2016. 

If you want to participate please let me know. If you have questions please ask. Contact informations about the authors is in the tex file.

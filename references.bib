Abstract = {Although theoretical and empirical work on topics related to meaning and meaning making proliferate, careful evaluation and integration of this area have not been carried out. Toward this end, this article has 3 goals: (a) to elaborate the critical dimensions of meaning as it relates to stressful life events and conditions, (b) to extend the transactional model of stress and coping to include these dimensions, and (c) to provide a framework for understanding current research and directions for future research within this extended model. First, the authors present a framework for understanding diverse conceptual and operational definitions of meaning by distinguishing 2 levels of meaning, termed global meaning and situational meaning. Second, the authors use this framework to review and synthesize the literature on the functions of meaning in the coping process and propose a definition of meaning making that highlights the critical role of reappraisal. The authors specify the roles of },

Abstract = {Self-harm has been identified as a clinical feature in at least a subgroup of women with bulimia nervosa. We explored how women with bulimia who engage in self-harming behaviors differ from women with bulimia without self-harming behaviors and from women with bulimia who attempt suicide with lethal intent. We compared features of the eating disorder, Axis I and II comorbidity, and Eating Disorder Inventory and Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) scores across 19 women with bulimia who engaged in self-harming behaviors, 28 women with bulimia who reported suicide attempts with lethal intent, and 105 women with bulimia with no self-harming or suicidal behaviors. Women with bulimia nervosa and self-harm behaviors reported significantly more laxative abuse and drug abuse in general. Bulimic women with suicide attempts had the highest rates of overall comorbidity across the three groups. Individuals with self-harm scored significantly higher on the self-transcendence scale of the TCI.},
